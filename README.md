# Web Crawler Test

Write a simple web crawler in a programming language of your choice. The
crawler should be limited to one domain - so when crawling SEDNA.com it would
crawl all pages within the domain, but not follow external links, for example
to the LinkedIn and Twitter accounts. Given a URL, it should output a site map,
showing which static assets each page depends on, and the links between pages.
